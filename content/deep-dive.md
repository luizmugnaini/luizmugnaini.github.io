Since 2020 I began a journey latexifying all my studies in mathematics. In this
process I'm able to engage more with the development of proofs and arguing about
certain statements. Thinking that my notes may enlighten another soul seeking
for mathematical knowledge, I decided to turn *Deep Dive* public.

Yes, *Deep Dive* is the name I've poetically given to this set of always-growing
personal notes, it represents a continuous and endless investigation of
mathematics. By the fact that this document is only a draft and furthermore a
collection of *personal* notes for my own sake and pleasure, I can only
guarantee the reader that there certainly exists an extensive list of linguistic
and mathematical errors spread throughout the whole document. However, *when time
seems fit* I plan to revise this work and rewrite various old sections and,
through this process, probably catch most of the silly errors.

The first propulsor of this journey was a draft of [Dongryul
Kim](https://web.stanford.edu/~dkim04/) named *[A rough guide to linear
algebra](https://web.stanford.edu/~dkim04/blog/linear-algebra-book/)*, which aims
to give a sophisticated introduction to linear algebra utilising the language of
*category theory* extensively. My interaction with this draft settled my path to
the world of *abstraction* in mathematics, and for that I'm much thankful.

found in my github.
