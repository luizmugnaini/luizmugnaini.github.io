Since 2020, I embarked on a journey to write all my studies in mathematics
through LaTeX.
This process has enabled me to dive deeper into the development of proofs and
engage in insightful discussions about a diverse range of mathematical
constructions.
With the hope of illuminating the path for fellow seekers of mathematical
knowledge, I decided to share my collection of notes publicly.

_Deep Dive_ is the evocative title I've chosen for this ever-evolving collection
of personal notes.
It represents a continuous and endless exploration of the realm of mathematics.
To that end, I claim absolutely _no_ originality in any of my writings,
instead they can be thought as a compilation of books and papers I've read,
written on my own words.

It must be stressed that this document is an endless work in progress and will
never be finished.
It primarily serves as a repository of personal notes created for my own
benefit and enjoyment.
Therefore, I must acknowledge the presence of numerous linguistic and
mathematical errors scattered throughout this document.
However, as time permits, I plan to revise and refine this work in some distant
future.
In doing so, I hope to rectify most of the silly mistakes and errors.

The first propulsor of this journey was a draft of [Dongryul Kim](https://web.stanford.edu/~dkim04/)
titled [_A rough guide to linear algebra_](https://web.stanford.edu/~dkim04/blog/linear-algebra-book/),
which aims to give a sophisticated introduction to linear algebra; making
extensive use of the language of _category theory_.
My interaction with this draft settled my path to the world of _abstraction_
in mathematics, and for that I'm profoundly grateful.
