As a final project for my [mathematical-physics class](https://sites.google.com/view/cristian-ortiz/usp2022-math-physics)
I studied the categorical equivalence between 2-dimensional topological
quantum field theories (TQFT) and the category of commutative Frobenius algebras.
This led to an interesting study paper, which I'm now making publicly accessible.

The paper is divided into 9 sections:

1. _Monoidal categories_: This section serves as the foundation language of the
   paper, monoidal categories and their properties.
2. _Braided & symmetric monoidal categories_: Here, we briefly delve into a
   special class of monoidal categories that permit commutative behaviour with
   respect to the associated bifunctor product.
3. _Cobordisms_: Central idea to topological quantum field theories is the idea
   of gluing smooth compact manifolds without boundary, which is what cobordisms
   are all about.
4. _Elements of Morse theory_: We provide a very introductory discussion of Morse theory,
   just showing some key results required for the rest of the paper.
5. _The category `n-cob`_: One of the building blocks of the main theorem of
   the paper is the category of cobordisms of a given dimension `n`,
   comprised compact oriented `(n - 1)`-dimensional manifolds.
6. _Monoidal structure of `n-cob`_: As expected, the category of cobordisms
   exhibits some good properties, and in particular it admits a monoidal
   structure.
7. _Frobenius Algebras_: Within the framework of monoidal categories, we study
   our second main character of our study in the paper, Frobenius algebras.
8. _Topological quantum field theories_: In this section we can finally define
   what we mean by a _TQFT_.
9. _Equivalence theorems_: Reaching to the climax of the paper, we delve into the
   theorems that motivated the paper's creation in the first place.
