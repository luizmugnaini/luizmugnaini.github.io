I recently got interested in the idea of emulating hardware and one of my goals
is to emulate a Gameboy. Searching the web which path to take, I found out that
the best idea would be to create a
[CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) interpreter. Embarking on this
journey, I built [`chirp`](https://github.com/luizmugnaini/chirp).
