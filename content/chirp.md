One of my long-term aspirations is to forge an emulator for the legendary [Game Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy)
console. As a side-quest, I decided to write a virtual machine for the
[CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) interpreted language from the mid-1970's.
Although not a hardware emulation project, it makes you dig a bit into techniques common
to emulation software.

The heart of [`chirp`](https://git.sr.ht/~presheaf/chirp) is an interpreter of
the CHIP-8 programming language, with roots in the early days of game
development. This project can serve as a learning material for someone
interested in dipping their toes in low-level waters.

I tried to make the external dependencies as minimal as possible:

- [`rand`](https://crates.io/crates/rand).
- [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/).

Sure, the number of dependencies is minimal, but that doesn't make the external code smaller.
Being Rust, you can see that these dependencies are definitely not minimal. SDL2 is an absolute beast
and many of its features are not necessary for this project, it could be completely replaced.

Throughout the creation of `chirp`, I found [Cowgod's CHIP-8 Technical Reference](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM)
to be an awesome resource, serving as the main reference for the project.
