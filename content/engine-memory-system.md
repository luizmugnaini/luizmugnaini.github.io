<!--TODO: This intro is pretty shitty, write a better one -->
I'm building a game engine from scratch in C++ so I decided to document this
journey. For the time being, we shall only depend on libc itself since my goal
is to squeeze every little bit of information I can gain from this project.

In this blog post I'll introduce how to build a simple memory system using a
simple stack allocator and a memory statistics tracking system.

With this technique, we'll be able to simulate dynamic memory allocation, even
though we'll call `malloc` once and for all at the start of the program, which
is a *huge* advantage in both performance and safety! This allows us to build
an API in which pointers

# First questions to ask when building your own memory system

When writing any API, one should question itself the scope and the audience of
the API. In the case of a memory management system, the main concern is centred
in safety. How much safety guard-rails should we build and how much
hand-holding does our end-user need?

Guard-rails obviously comes with their own performance costs. For instance, if
we wanted a very robust system that disallows for any use-after-free, we
wouldn't be returning direct pointers to the memory to our users. To deal with
that, we could use handles and manage their coherence internally (check
[this post](https://floooh.github.io/2018/06/17/handles-vs-pointers.html), by
Andre Weissflog, for more information). This would require every allocation to
have a unique ID, every read request to be checked if ID's match, etc.

In my personal case, as a solo developer of this engine, I don't really need
all of this hand-holding. For the sake of performance, I decided to go for raw pointers
and their inherent unsafe behaviour. This may change in the future though...

# Simple Stack Allocator

## Headers: storing relevant information

Each memory block allocated by our stack allocator will be accompanied by a
header that will carry some basic information about the memory block it's
associated:

```cpp
struct StackAllocHeader {
    size_t padding;
    size_t capacity;
    size_t previous_offset;
};
```

Let me explain what each one of these fields mean:

- `padding`: The offset relative to the *end* of the previously allocated
  memory block, to the start of the current memory block. You may think this is
  unnecessary, but each allocation has to take care of memory alignment! Relax,
  we'll cover all that in due time.
- `capacity`: The total capacity, in bytes, of the current memory block.
- `previous_offset`: The offset relative to the *start* of the stack allocator
  memory block. This will help us keep

TODO: Of course you could write a more light weight header, but that is up
      to you (reader).

In other words, what we have can be summarized by the following diagram:

```md
         previous offset              alignment              |----- capacity -----|
                ^                     ^       ^              ^                    ^
                |                     |       |              |                    |
|previous header|previous memory block|+++++++|current header|current memory block|
                                      ^                      ^
                                      |------- padding ------|
```

## Alignment: rules for memory reads

<!-- TODO: Alignment -->

## Stack allocator

On to the stack allocator proper! The basic layout of the allocator looks like
the following diagram:

```md
       previous
        offset
     for header 2
           ^                            current
           |       alignment            offset
           |        ^    ^                 ^
           |        |    |                 |
  |header 1|memory 1|++++|header 2|memory 2|++free space++|
  ^                 ^             ^                       ^
  |                 |---padding---|                       |
memory                            |                      end
  |                            previous                   |
  |                             offset                    |
  |                                                       |
  |--------------------- capacity ------------------------|
```

The stack allocator consists of the following:

- A pointer `memory` to the start of the memory block it's responsible to
  manage.
- A total `capacity` in bytes that its memory can hold.
- An `offset` relative to `memory` to the allocator's free space.
- The `previous_offset` relative to `memory` to the start of the previously
  allocated memory block.

Each block provided by the stack allocator consists of an *alignment* offset
with respect to the end of the previous block, a *header*, and the available
block of *memory* requested by the user.

The *padding* block of memory is preceded by a padding that comprises both the
alignment needed for the memory block and its corresponding header. This header
will store the size of the  padding and the offset to the start the previous
memory block with respect to itself.

The allocator can be either the owner or merely the manager of the memory
pointed by `memory`. If the allocator is the owner, the user should always call
`stack_destroy` in order to free resources. If a block of memory is to be
provided to the allocator for only management, the user may instantiate the
allocator via `stack_init` with a valid pointer to the available memory.

The basic struct will look like the following

```cpp
struct StackAlloc {
    uint8_t* memory = nullptr;
    size_t capacity = 0;
    size_t offset = 0;
    size_t previous_offset = 0;

    StackAlloc(size_t const capacity);
    ~StackAlloc();

     * @brief Allocates a block of memory of a given size and alignment.
     *
     * @param size      Size, in bytes, of the new memory block.
     * @param alignment The needed alignment of the new memory block. This
     *                  number should always be a power of two.

### Suggestion: use templates in your favor

Create additional methods that compute the alignment automatically. You could
do something like

```cpp
template <typename T>
T* alloc(size_t const length) {
    return reinterpret_cast<T*>(alloc(length * sizeof(T), alignof(T)));
}
```

as a method of `StackAlloc`. This will give your user a better experience as
they'll only need to pass the number of entities of type `T` that the requested
block should be able to carry.

You can also add a default value for the alignment in case the user doesn't
want to provide one. One option could be `2 * sizeof(void*)`.

# The Memory System

In this engine we'll have a central memory system that will carry out every
allocation and freeing of memory

# Some failures of the system

<!-- TODO: Why you might not want to use this system at all -->

# Further reading material for the nerds

Memory management systems are actually quite fun and interesting. Although they
may seem scary at first, one can build a simple memory system that outperforms
most uses of smart-pointers, garbage-collected languages. It goes without
saying that having a good memory system frees you from the paranoia that
`malloc` will inherently generate.
