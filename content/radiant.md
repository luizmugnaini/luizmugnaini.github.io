Some time ago I decided to start learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/),
and as a starting project I followed [_Ray Tracing in One
Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) by
Peter Shirley and hence [`radiant`](https://github.com/luizmugnaini/radiant) was
born.  Although much work still has to be done, the project already produces
some cool pictures.

          caption="Random scene generated by radiant",
          caption_style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;") }}
