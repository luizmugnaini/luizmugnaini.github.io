Since 2020, I started documenting all of my studies in mathematics. This
process ended up generating something that resembles a book. This journey has
enabled me to dive deeper into the development of proofs and mathematical
constructions. It is with the hope of illuminating the path for fellow seekers of
mathematical knowledge, that I decided to share my collection of notes publicly.

_Deep Dive_ is the title I've chosen for this ever-evolving collection of
personal notes. It represents a continuous and endless exploration of gigantic
sea of mathematics. With that being said, I claim absolutely _no_ originality
in any of my writings, instead they can be thought as a compilation of lectures
I've watched, as well as books and papers I've read --- but written down on my own
words and with my own explanations.

It must be stressed that this document is an endless work in progress and will
_never_ be finished. It primarily serves as a repository of personal notes
created for my own benefit and enjoyment. Therefore, I must acknowledge the
presence of numerous linguistic and mathematical errors scattered throughout
this document. However, as time permits, I plan to revise and refine this work
in some distant future. In doing so, I hope to rectify most of my silly
mistakes and errors I've made along the way.

The first propulsor of this journey was a draft of [Dongryul Kim](https://web.stanford.edu/~dkim04/)
titled [_A rough guide to linear algebra_](https://web.stanford.edu/~dkim04/blog/linear-algebra-book/),
which aims to give a sophisticated introduction to linear algebra; making
extensive use of the language of _category theory_ --- it was probably my first
introduction to actual modern mathematics. My interaction with this
draft settled my path to the world of _abstraction_ in mathematics, and for
that I'm profoundly grateful. For this exact reason I thought of making _Deep
Dive_ available for anyone that might be interested in this kind of mathematics.

The source of _Deep Dive_ is available on my GitHub at

Additionally, a compiled version of the document can be
