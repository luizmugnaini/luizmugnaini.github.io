Since 2020, I started documenting all of my studies in mathematics. This
process ended up generating something that resembles a book. It is with the
hope of illuminating the path for fellow nerds that I decided to share my
collection of notes publicly.

_Deep Dive_ is the title I've chosen for my ever-evolving collection of
personal notes. I claim absolutely _no_ originality in any of my writings,
instead they can be thought as a compilation of lectures I've watched, as well
as books and papers I've read --- but written down on my own words and with my
own explanations.

It must be stressed that this document is an endless work in progress and will
_never_ be finished. It primarily serves as a repository of personal notes
created for my own benefit. Therefore, I must acknowledge the presence of
numerous linguistic and mathematical errors scattered throughout this document.
As time permits, I plan to revise and refine this work in some distant future
--- rectifying most of my silly mistakes and errors I've made along the way.

The first propulsor of this set of notes was a draft of [Dongryul Kim](https://web.stanford.edu/~dkim04/)
titled [_A rough guide to linear algebra_](https://web.stanford.edu/~dkim04/blog/linear-algebra-book/),
which aims to give a sophisticated introduction to linear algebra; making
extensive use of  _category theory_ --- it was probably my first introduction
to actual modern mathematics. My interaction with this draft settled my journey
in mathematics, and for that I'm profoundly grateful. For this exact reason I
thought of making _Deep Dive_ available for anyone that might be interested in
this kind of writing.

The source of _Deep Dive_ is available on my GitHub at [luizmugnaini/deep-dive](https://github.com/luizmugnaini/deep-dive).
Additionally, a compiled version of the document can be found [here](/deep-dive.pdf).
