Hi! My name full name is Luiz Gustavo Mugnaini Anselmo. I'm an undergraduate
student in *Molecular Sciences* at the University of Sao Paulo (USP). Together
with my advisor [Ivan Struchiner](https://www.ime.usp.br/~ivanstru) we study
*abstract homotopy theory* via *model categories*. Besides mathematics, I'm
interested in *systems programming* and *data science*, quite distinct areas, I
know! My CV can be found [here](/cv-luizmug.pdf)

My life has always been revolved by *art* and *music*, I'm always fascinated by
discovering new artists and genres. Another hobby of mine is that of reading,
currently I'm going through the russian classic *Anna Karenina* by [Leo Tolstoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy).
