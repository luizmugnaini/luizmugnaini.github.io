Hello there! I'm Luiz, a Brazilian programmer and a Master's student in Computer Science at the
University of Sao Paulo (USP).

My interests are very diverse, and currently I focus mostly in pure/applied mathematics, computer
graphics and game development.

I love to implement stuff from scratch, mostly in C and C++. I also sometimes do some scripting in
Python and Lua.

I'm currently researching discrete differential geometry and its applications to computer graphics,
together with my supervisor Sinai Robins.

Previously, I've done some research in pure mathematics. More specifically, together with my advisor
[Ivan Struchiner](https://www.ime.usp.br/~ivanstru), we studied [_abstract homotopy theory_](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/homotopy+theory)
via [_model categories_](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/model+category). You can find my academic CV
[here](/academic-cv.pdf).

Feel free to explore my blog and connect with me. I'm always eager to exchange some cool ideas.
