Hello there! I'm Luiz, a Brazilian programmer and an undergraduate student in
[_Molecular Sciences_](http://www.cecm.usp.br/) at the University of Sao Paulo (USP).

My interests are very diverse, but I'm particularly passionate about
_mathematics_, _computer graphics_ and _game development_.
I enjoy working with languages such as Rust, Python, and more recently, C++.

Previously, I delved into the abstract realm of pure mathematics.
More specifically, together with my advisor [Ivan Struchiner](https://www.ime.usp.br/~ivanstru),
we studied [_abstract homotopy theory_](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/homotopy+theory)
via [_model categories_](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/model+category).
My CV can be found [here](/cv-luizmug.pdf).

My life has always been revolved by _art_ and _music_.
I'm constantly in the lookout for new artists and genres to explore.
In my free time, I also enjoy a good read.
Currently I'm going through the russian classic _Anna Karenina_ by
[Leo Tolstoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy).

Feel free to explore my blog and connect with me. I'm always eager to engage
with fellow enthusiasts and exchange ideas.
