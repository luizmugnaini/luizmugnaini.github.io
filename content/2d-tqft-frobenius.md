As a final project for my [mathematical-physics
      class](https://sites.google.com/view/cristian-ortiz/usp2022-math-physics)
I decided to study the categorical equivalence between 2-dimensional
topological quantum field theories and the category of commutative
Frobenius algebras. The paper can be found
[here](/pdf/2d-tqft-frobenius.pdf).
